# Voice AI Feature for CookMate

This feature adds voice command capabilities to the CookMate application, allowing users to ask cooking-related questions using voice input.

## Features

- Voice recording and processing
- Speech-to-text transcription
- Integration with Google Generative AI for intelligent responses
- Conversation history display
- Demo mode with predefined cooking responses

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install expo-av @google/generative-ai
   ```

2. To use the Google AI functionality, you'll need to obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey).

3. The feature can be used in demo mode without an API key (using predefined responses).

## Usage

The Voice AI feature consists of these main components:

- `VoiceAIService`: Handles voice recording and audio processing
- `GoogleAIService`: Communicates with the Google Generative AI API
- `VoiceAIComponent`: UI component for the recording button and transcription display
- `VoiceAIScreen`: Main screen that orchestrates all components and displays conversations

### Integration

To integrate into your app:

```tsx
import { VoiceAIScreen } from './features/voiceAI';

export default function App() {
  return <VoiceAIScreen />;
}
```

## Demo Mode

The feature currently operates in a demo mode where:

1. Voice input is simulated by returning predefined cooking-related questions
2. Responses are either hardcoded for common cooking questions or generated by Google AI when an API key is provided

## Future Enhancements

- Implement actual speech-to-text using Google Speech API or Whisper API
- Add voice output for AI responses
- Improve error handling and offline capabilities
- Implement user preferences for voice interaction
